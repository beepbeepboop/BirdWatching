# CAR app
This app was designed to replace the current Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) project forms that are filled out on paper.

To download the app and test it on your phone:
1) find the CARapp.apk file in the github repository
2) click download
3) say yes when it warns you it's harmful
4) your phone will then say "android protects you from these types of files, go to settings to change this", click the settings button and allow google drive to let you download .apk files. (it should be a one time thing)
5) click install
6) google play protect might also warn you against opening the app. ignore them too.

Please fill out the following survey to be used as results for the final year project::
